This approach enables teachers to better understand and support students' development throughout the year in a relaxed and stress-free environment. While multiple formative and summative assessments will take place across subjects, parents will not be informed prior to their administration, to ensure assessments reflect authentic learning and reduce performance anxiety. However, in response to parent feedback and to support home preparation, schedules will be shared in advance for Arabic and Islamic Studies assessments only."
